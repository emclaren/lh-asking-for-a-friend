About:
AskingForAFriend is a resourcetool to assist those who are looking to receive help addressing mental health challenges. Our name is a reference to the guise under which many people seek help. (They often ask for advice on behalf of their “friend”.) AskingForAFriend is a safe and supportive chatbot with which users can anonymously connect, learn, and gain support.

Bot was coded in node.js using Microsoft Azure Bot Framework, and could be easily integrated into social media networks such as Facebook messenger. This is saved in this repository under bot-code.js
