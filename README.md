About:
AskingForAFriend is a resourcetool to assist those who are looking to receive help addressing mental health challenges. Our name is a reference to the guise under which many people seek help. (They often ask for advice on behalf of their “friend”.) AskingForAFriend is a safe and supportive chatbot with which users can anonymously connect, learn, and gain support.
